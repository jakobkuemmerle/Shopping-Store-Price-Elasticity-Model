IntroductionWelcome, everyone. Today, we're delving into how Dillard's can revolutionize its discount strategies. Despite our diverse range of products and pricing strategies, we face the challenge of not fully capitalizing on optimized discounts, potentially leaving significant profits on the table. This presentation will unveil how a data-centric strategy can transform our pricing models, leading to increased revenue and customer satisfaction.  Let's start by exploring our current discounting strategy. At Dillard's, discounts range from 0% to a substantial 80%, varying across different stores, brands, and items. They also differ in duration and timing. A critical insight is that just 4.5% of our SKUs generate half of our revenue. These high-impact items are our primary focus.However, we face a challenge: our current discounting lacks a clear pattern for optimization. We haven't fully considered customer preferences and buying habits, which can lead to potential loss of profit. For instance, if we discount a popular item too deeply without understanding customer demand, we might miss out on higher revenue from less aggressive discounts.Here's our proposal: A Data-Driven Discount Strategy. By harnessing customer data, we can tailor discounts to match customer preferences and purchase patterns. This approach isn't just about changing numbers; it's about intelligently adapting our strategy to what our data tells us about our customers and their buying behavior. This way, we can optimize our discounts, maximize revenue, and better meet our customers' needs. MethodologyIn our methodology, a key component is the use of association rule mining with the Apriori Market Basket Algorithm. This technique helps us to uncover relationships between products in our vast transaction data. For example, if we find that customers often buy shirts and ties together, this is an association rule. Out Market Basket Algorithm, has been trained on 100,000 baskets, focusing exclusively on items that are most relevant to our revenue stream. These include:* Items that constitute 50% of our revenue, indicating their critical role in our sales.* Products with more than two price points, allowing us to analyze the impact of different pricing strategies.* Products with a known launch date, enabling us to understand buying patterns from the product introduction phase.Our selection criteria are stringent. We're looking for patterns with a lift greater than 30% and a support level of at least 0.001, ensuring we focus on significant and relevant associations. This approach guarantees scalability, allowing us to apply these insights across various product lines and stores effectively.  After identifying items with strong associations, we proceed with a tailored approach using random forest regression for each item. This model predicts the number of sales based on our transaction data, complemented by web-scraped demographic information like population and median income from each item's relevant zip code. We also factor in time constraints, such as the duration since the product launch, to refine our predictions.  Once we have fitted a model for an individual item, the next step is to simulate various discount strategies. This simulation predicts the demand for each strategy, allowing us to calculate the potential profit from each. For each item identified through the Association Rule, we employ the Price Demand Model to predict the impact of varying discount levels. We simulate discounts ranging from 0% to 80%, in 5% intervals. For each discount level, we predict demand and then calculate the profit, which is the price minus cost. Our goal is to select the discount level that maximizes profit. This method allows us to tailor discounts precisely for each item, aligning our pricing strategy with market demand and profitability objectives, ultimately leading to a more efficient and effective discounting process.Using basket 209 which contains 2 items to illustrate our results. The graph on the left shows our predicted revenue based on various levels of discounts for item 6696135. The maximum predicted revenue is $16,227.53, occurring at a 10% discount from 4,225.92 sales. And similarly, for item 6656135, setting discount to 5% will maximize profit. By using this model, we can potentially increase profits by over $20,000 through dynamic pricing of just these two items. However, a current limitation of our approach is that it considers items independently rather than in combination. To further enhance our strategy, we should plan future field experiments focusing on discount strategies based on association rules. This will help us understand which item discounts can drive overall sales increases, leading to a more holistic and effective discounting strategy.RecommendationsOur immediate actions include extending the duration of discounts and adjusting prices of targeted SKUs to validate our model's accuracy. Long-term, we aim to gather more customer history data, refine our Price Elasticity Model with advanced features, and scale our models across all data. The investment in AWS Environment and a dedicated team of data scientists and a product owner, coupled with marketing quality assurance, involves a significant annual cost. However, with an expected profit increase of $1 million per year, we project a return on investment by the third year.ConclusionTo maintain our competitive edge, action is needed to benchmark against the industry. We must synchronize with the Marketing Team, especially regarding pricing strategies to ensure cohesion. Concurrently, a controlled case study should be conducted in one selected location to gather real-world data on the effectiveness of our strategies. Decision points will revolve around the outcomes of these initiatives, guiding further investment and scaling of our data-driven pricing model.
